# Introduction to C4 Modelling
The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase. It's a way to create maps of your code, at various levels of detail.

## Plant UML

C4-PlantUML combines the benefits of [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) and the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) for providing a simple way of describing and communicate software architectures – especially during up-front design sessions – with an intuitive language using open source and platform independent tools

### Setup vscode

- Under the Marketplace extensions, add PlantUML and PlantUMLPreview

- Under the source code of any diagram with the `.puml` extension, type the following to preview the diagram

  ```powershell
  CTRL + P (Windows/Linux)
  CMD + P (Mac)
  ```

- **Note** there are other ways with installing GraphViz and other previewers but this was the simplest for me to get going
